# Sorting-Algorithms
 
 This consists of implementing the below sorting algorithms followed by their analysis based on their running time on different input sizes. It also consists of analyzing couple of special cases which includes analyzing the running time of these algorithms for an already sorted array and reversely sorted array.


- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot).
- Modified quicksort
    a. Use median-of-three as pivot.
    b. For small subproblem size (â‰¤10), you must use insertion sort.

All the sorting algorithms have been implemented in Java using Math.random() function to generate random numbers in range of 0 to 50000 for all the cases.
